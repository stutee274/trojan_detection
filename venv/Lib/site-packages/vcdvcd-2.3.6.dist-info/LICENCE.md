Copyright holders:

* 2012 Gene Sullivan
* 2016 Sameer Gauria
* 2017 onwards: Ciro Santilli. See Git for exact dates of each change.

This means that for sure you can have dual licensing under:

* [Artistic License 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_License), which in Ciro's understanding is not copyleft
* [GPL v1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_1), copyleft

Ideally Ciro Santilli would like to license this package would be fully MIT, but it depends on how much you believe that it has become a complete rewrite of Sameer's version through Ciro's changes or not. Upon a quick review as of 2022, Ciro can see only some very small similarities, and maybe a rewrite could be argued. But yeah, use diff and ask you lawyer.

And if you can live with Artistic License 1.0, just use that, which is for sure correct.

Development history is as follows.

Ciro Santilli forked this from Verilog_VCD 1.11 by Sameer Guaria in 2017.

Guaria's files can be downloaded at: <https://pypi.org/project/Verilog_VCD/#files> The main file `Verilog_VCD/Verilog_VCD.py` contains:

As of 2022 the link <http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/GSULLIVAN/Verilog-VCD-0.03/lib/Verilog/VCD.pm> is dead, but we can see it at: <https://metacpan.org/release/GSULLIVAN/Verilog-VCD-0.03/source/lib/Verilog/VCD.pm>.
