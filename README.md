This project detects hardware Trojans in FPGA designs by analyzing signal activity from VCD (Value Change Dump) files. A total of 12 Verilog testbenches were createdâ€”comprising both trusted and Trojan-infected modules. The system extracts side-channel features such as toggle rate, glitches, entropy, and jump patterns from critical signals, and uses a trained Random Forest model to classify new designs with high accuracy.each day i will be adding new files to train my model properly so that it will correctly predict trojan values from trusted files.


IN result.png  it has been shown how the model is giving probability and accuracy results by connecting predicting when i add a new file dumptrojanT.vcd in vcd_dumps and my model found it to be trojan.
I am learning to do side channel analysis in hardware level.
